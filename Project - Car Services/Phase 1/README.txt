Introduction
The overall purpose of this project is to redefine car sales by automating the entire process beginning from selection and ending in a successful deal. This application enhances the customer car shopping experience by keeping a constant focus on the customer’s requirements and satisfaction.
Highlights of this application are:
o Customer can become a member by creating a profile within the application.
o Various providers also register themselves.
o There is an admin which maintains all the profiles.
o Login authentication using social media site like Facebook.
o Customers can search for the car they have in mind using various criteria and start their short-listing process by viewing the exact cars and what they have to offer as specified by the search results.
o Multiple dealers can have their cars showcased with all details and customer can browse and select through them.
o Customers can maintain a profile in which they could shortlist cars they are interested in.
o Apart from cars customers can also buy/sell various car parts.
o A secure billing channel is maintained.
The web application will be a channel partner and become point of contact to sell cars available in the provider car lot. A major challenge to be overcome is to bridge the gap between various technologies used by different partner dealerships and provide a single point of access to the end consumer.
The application does not intend to limit its partnerships to select few dealerships but instead requires that the solution be flexible and scalable to add and remove providers. One of the ways the requirement can be satisfied is to provide a web-service to provide a unified method to access information available in their own database along with information obtained via the adaptation layer.
