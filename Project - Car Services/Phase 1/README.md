# Phase 1 (Requirements and Hight Level Design) 

## 1.1	Requirement Specification Document (RSD) 
* Using Unified Modeling Language use case standards develop a detailed Use Case Diagram that captures how users of the application uses the application.  
* Requirements table.  You should capture the required ID, Description, Version and Priority (High, Low and Medium).

## 1.2Design Phase
* Build an Architecture (for example using MVC). Mention all the modules of the application in the architecture. These modules should be reusable.
* Database Design -tools to capture database design such as Entity Relationship Diagram. Output of this will be an SQL command
* UML Class Diagram - show the structure of all classes including hierarchy of the classes, interfaces etc.
* High level architecture diagram: Boxes and lines of all modules showing how they interconnect

## 1.3Web Services Design
10 webservices APIs that you plan on implementing in this application.  For example, if you decide to build a web service to return the list of all customers who rented cars in a specific city then the API for this service will look like this:
	ArrayList<String> getRentalCustomersByCity(String city);
