# Construct XML Files

Build XML Files for all entities in your project with some test data. 
Then build a parser that converts the XML elements into SQL and populate the database.  You can use any RDBMS.  You need to use:
1.	DOM or Event based (SAX) java parser packages.
1.	For database connection use JDBC.  (you can use JPA, or ORM: Hibernate or TopLink).
1.	You must have all XML files for your project.
