  ## Phase 1 - Requirements and High Level Design 
   ### 1.1 Requirement Specification Document (RSD) 
* Using Unified Modeling Language use case standards develop a detailed Use Case Diagram that captures how users of the application uses the application.  
* Requirements table.  You should capture the required ID, Description, Version and Priority (High, Low and Medium).

### 1.2 Design Phase
* Build an Architecture (for example using MVC). Mention all the modules of the application in the architecture. These modules should be reusable.
* Database Design -tools to capture database design such as Entity Relationship Diagram. Output of this will be an SQL command
* UML Class Diagram - show the structure of all classes including hierarchy of the classes, interfaces etc.
* High level architecture diagram: Boxes and lines of all modules showing how they interconnect

### 1.3 Web Services Design
10 webservices APIs that you plan on implementing in this application.  For example, if you decide to build a web service to return the list of all customers who rented cars in a specific city then the API for this service will look like this:
	ArrayList<String> getRentalCustomersByCity(String city);s 
   
## Phase 1.5 - Construct XML Files + JDBC database connection
  Build XML Files for all entities in your project with some test data. 
Then build a parser that converts the XML elements into SQL and populate the database.  You can use any RDBMS.  You need to use:
1.	DOM or Event based (SAX) java parser packages.
1.	For database connection use JDBC.  (you can use JPA, or ORM: Hibernate or TopLink).
1.	You must have all XML files for your project.
